# Likes-vs-Dislikes-using-EEG-Signals-Binary-Classifier-for-Neuromarketing
Binary Classifier for Neuromarketing uses EEG data to classify customer preferences for different products.
Implemented with 3 different classification models: 

(1). Logistic Regression

(2). Support Vector Machine (SVM)

(3). Neural Network

Out of thesee 3 models, Neural Network gave the best performance for the 1st dataset: 

|  Sr No.|          Model         | Accuracy (%) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|
|    1   | Logistic regression    |    77.03     |
|    2   | Support Vector Machine |    79.5      |
|    3   | Neural Network         |    83.2      |


Tested on 2nd dataset, Logistic Regression performed the best this time:

|  Sr No.|          Model         | Accuracy (%) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|
|    1   | Logistic regression    |    86.6      |
|    2   | Support Vector Machine |    33.3      |
|    3   | Neural Network         |    33.3      |
