# Likes-vs-Dislikes-using-EEG-Signals-Binary-Classifier-for-Neuromarketing
Binary Classifier for Neuromarketing uses EEG data to classify customer preferences for different products.
Implemented with 3 different classification models: 

(1). Logistic Regression

(2). Support Vector Machine (SVM)

(3). Neural Network

Out of thesee 3 models, Neural Network gave the best performance for the 1st dataset: 

|  Sr No.|          Model         | Accuracy (%) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|
|    1   | Logistic regression    |    77.03     |
|    2   | Support Vector Machine |    79.5      |
|    3   | Neural Network         |    83.2      |


Tested on 2nd dataset, Logistic Regression performed the best this time:

|  Sr No.|          Model         | Accuracy (%) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|
|    1   | Logistic regression    |    86.6      |
|    2   | Support Vector Machine |    33.3      |
|    3   | Neural Network         |    33.3      |




1st dataset was taken from from the paper titled "Analysis of EEG signals and its application
to neuromarketing" by Mahendra Yadava et al. 

2nd dataset was recorded after practical experiment in the Lab.
