# Likes-vs-Dislikes-using-EEG-Signals-Binary-Classifier-for-Neuromarketing
Binary Classifier for Neuromarketing uses EEG data to classify customer preferences for different products.
Implemented with 3 different classification models: 

(1). Logistic Regression
(2). Support Vector Machine (SVM)
(3). Neural Network

Out of thesee 3 models, Neural Network gave the best performance.
